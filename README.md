* To deploy a PWA-ready web app
* To integrate Flutter Web for seamless performance

### **Methodology:**

1. **Flutter Web Setup**
2. **Firebase + Google OAuth configuration**
3. **HTML meta integration for Google Sign-In**
4. **UI implementation in Flutter**
5. **Testing on multiple devices**
6. **Deploying the web build**

### **Result:**

A working Flutter Web Application with PWA support and Google login capability.

### **Conclusion:**

This project demonstrates the ability to integrate secure authentication into a cross-platform Flutter environment, making it suitable for real-world web app deployments.
